Hello Readers, 

I know we have been dormant for a very long time, the reason being the end of our third year of B.Tech and summer vacations. Most of our team members were busy with their internship and hence we couldnt get time to work upon this project. 
As soon as our college opened, we started our work and divided the project amongst our team members. 

Following is the breakup of our project : 

* [Deepankar Kr. Singh][depp1993] :  UI/UX , Login Dean Academics, Notices/Announcements , MNNIT Maps [ improve ] , Server side programming and back end. 
* [Akshay Kamthan][Akamthan] :  Planner and Time Table **
* [Chandrabhan Giri][cbgiri] : 	Attendance system [ just as Whitemarker ] **
* [Avinash Kumar Bawane][avinashbawane] : UI/UX , Emergency Services, Complaint Management system.
* [Anil Kumar Verma][anil23416] : static content of the apps , information gathering and designing of Department and faculty information, College phone book, SAC and clubs etc.

**Chandrabhan and Akshay need to collaborate with each other in this part of project because both are interrelated.
There are many other things which need to be done, but for now this is what we have decided.

Looking forward to it! <br/>
Enjoy!
