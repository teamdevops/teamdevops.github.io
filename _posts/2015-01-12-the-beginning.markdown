* [Chandrabhan Giri][cbgiri]
* [Avinash Kumar Bawane][avinashbawane]
* [Anil Kumar Verma][anil23416]

This blog is dedicated to the project we are working upon currently. This is a college project and we are working under the mentorship of Professor [M.M.Gore][M.M.Gore]. This blog will contain all the updates and happenings throughout the development process of our project.

We were allotted our mentor to the project on JAN 9th, 2015. On 12th of Janurary, we met Gore Sir to introduce our team and to seek his guidance. We shared lots of information and ideas regarding the development process a project goes through, the key phase being the INCEPTION PHASE. Sir gave us full freedom to think upon a good project idea to work upon and scheduled the next meet on 19th Jan. To help us develop our thought process sir provided us each with various magazines and books, including [Distributed Computing and Internet Technology][icdcit], Communications of ACM ,Simulation and Modeling etc. This helped us how the software industry works and what is the thought process they go through before taking upon a project. 

<h1> Inception Phase </h1>

To decide upon what we should develop as our project, we had a lot of discussion and brainstorming sessions, where each and every team member gave their ideas. We wanted our project to be related to our college and to be used on daily basis and by everyone. How we can ease the lives of the students as well as the faculty members. How the administrative process of our college can be more transparent and effecient. And as its the era of Internet and Smartphones, we wanted to make full use of smartphones and Internet to develop a full fledged product catering to need of our clients and to ease their living.

To decide on which platform we will work, everybody shared there thoughts and expertise and came to a unanimous endpoint : [Android](www.android.com) as a platform for smartphones and relevant web application based on recent technologies (for ex. Google's [Polymer](www.polymer-project.org)).

After having a rigourous dicussion, considering all the aspects and scope, we came up with several ideas.
The ideas/areas we dicussed upon were : 

1. The Training and Placement Cell Application
2. MNNIT GPS Locator or MNNIT Maps
3. Interconnected Hostel Network
4. Advanced Attendance System
5. MNNITOverflow (Concept based on [StackOverflow](www.stackoverflow.com) + [Piazza](www.piazza.com))
6. Distributed Learning with session sharing and VoIP
7. Social Network for MNNIT

Other ideas included:

8. Connected Music and Recommendation System based on Machine Learning
9. Interactive text to voice translator

Now having decided all the ideas , we will meet Gore Sir and present our ideas to him. Lets see whether sir likes our ideas and what he recommends. We all are very excited and looking forward to it. To know which project we zeroed, wait for the next week entry. Till then,
