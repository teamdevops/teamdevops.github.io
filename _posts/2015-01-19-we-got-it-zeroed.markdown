Hello Readers!

Finally we have finalized our project! As scheduled we met on 19th Jan and presented all our project ideas to our mentor and exchanged views and thoughts. As this was a crucial phase, meeting went long and finally we decided to take upon a project which is:

A full flegded utility product to be used in our college, (for/of/by)everyone, for everything, and everywhere! 

<tt>Interconnected Network for MNNIT as an <b>Android Application</b> and <b>Web Application</b></tt>

It will contain innumerable features. You can think yourself what ALL we can do! :) <br/>
You will get to know as we go through the development process.

Our mentor, Prof Gore Sir backed us up with the idea we presented and extended his full support. He gave us study material for understanding process of mobile app development and to seek his help in any possible way! 

We have a project in hand. All we need to do is START! <br/>
